# Testing and Test Automation in Game Development

This repository explores the topic of testing and test automation in game development, focusing on testing practices within the Unity and Unreal game engines.

## Overview

In this project, we have created a simple Unity project to demonstrate the implementation of automated tests using the Unity Test Runner, which is a built-in testing framework in Unity.

## Features

- Implemented a function that calculates points based on the provided fire encounter.
- Created automated tests using Unity Test Runner to validate the functionality of the points calculation function.
- Ensured the accuracy of the tests by comparing expected values with the actual output using the `Assert` method.

## Installation

To run the automated tests and explore the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Unity project in Unity Editor.
3. Open the Unity Test Runner and navigate to the test suite.
4. Run the tests to verify the functionality of the points calculation function.

## Usage

The provided Unity project and automated tests serve as a starting point for understanding testing and test automation in game development. Feel free to explore the code, modify the tests, and adapt the concepts to your own projects.
